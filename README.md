> A: Sometimes SVG is superior for illustrations gradients anything with text, maps, graphs logos…

> B: Nope! Always PNG! PNG only!!! No thinking required!! I love PNG. PNG! PNG!

Inspired by the “SVG vs PNG” comix by Lockal, which was inspired by Louis Brandy’s “PNG vs JPEG” comix, which was inspired by the original xkcd comix, which was inspired by… hell if I know.
